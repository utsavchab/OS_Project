# OS_Project

## Heap Memory Management Project
This is a project for managing heap memory in a computer program. The purpose of this project is to provide a custom implementation of a dynamic memory allocator that manages the heap memory in a more efficient way than the default allocator provided by the operating system.

### Features
The project includes the following features:

**Memory Allocation**: The allocator provides functions to allocate memory from the heap, both for single objects and arrays.

**Memory Deallocation**: The allocator provides functions to deallocate memory that was previously allocated using the allocator.

## Instructions for running the files:
1. The final code is in [final.cpp](https://github.com/utsavchab/OS_Project/blob/main/final.cpp)
2. Theinput gven is in [main.cpp](https://github.com/utsavchab/OS_Project/blob/main/main.cpp)
3. The class defined for allocating and deallocating is in [HeapManager.h](https://github.com/utsavchab/OS_Project/blob/main/HeapManager.h)
