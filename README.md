# Operating System Project

## Heap Memory Management Project
This is a project for managing heap memory in a computer program. The purpose of this project is to provide a custom implementation of a dynamic memory allocator that manages the heap memory in a more efficient way than the default allocator provided by the operating system.

### Features
The project includes the following features:

**Memory Allocation**: The allocator provides functions to allocate memory from the heap, both for single objects and arrays.  
**Memory Deallocation**: The allocator provides functions to deallocate memory that was previously allocated using the allocator.

## Future implementation 
To allocate any size of memory. It helps in reducing excess memory allocation and gives flexibility in Storage Management.


## Motivation for the completion of the project
We wanted to know the working of the pre-defined allocater and deallocaters like 'new', 'malloc','calloc','del' etc. So we made this projct without use of these keywords from scratch with the help of Operating Systems concepts.

## Difficulties faced  
It was difficult to understand the concepts regarding allocation and deallocation. We find many new things which were hard to grasp. Also it was hard to code from scratch and make use of only basic libraries. All over the experience was very great and we learnt many new concepts.

## Instructions for running the files:
1. Input can be given via [test_version_2.0.cpp](https://github.com/utsavchab/OS_Project/blob/main/test_version_2.0.cpp)
2. The class defined for allocating and deallocating is in [HeapManager.h](https://github.com/utsavchab/OS_Project/blob/main/HeapManager.h)
